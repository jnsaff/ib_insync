## Description

Improve performance in the decoder and message processing pipeline. Optimize data structure operations and reduce memory allocations in high-frequency operations like tick data processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Message decoding performance improved
- [ ] Data structure operations optimized
- [ ] Memory allocations reduced in tick processing
- [ ] Benchmark tests added for performance validation
- [ ] Performance regression tests implemented
- [ ] CPU and memory profiling results show improvement
